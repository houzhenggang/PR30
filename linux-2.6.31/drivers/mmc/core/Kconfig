config MMC_UNSAFE_RESUME
	bool "Allow unsafe resume (DANGEROUS)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the MMC layer will assume that all cards
	  stayed in their respective slots during the suspend. The
	  normal behaviour is to remove them at suspend and
	  redetecting them at resume. Breaking this assumption will
	  in most cases result in data corruption.

	  This option is usually just for embedded systems which use
	  a MMC/SD card for rootfs. Most people should say N here.


config MMC_EMBEDDED_SDIO
        boolean "MMC embedded SDIO device support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
        depends on EXPERIMENTAL
        help
        If you say Y here, support will be added for embedded SDIO
        devices which do not contain the necessary enumeration
        support in hardware to be properly detected.
