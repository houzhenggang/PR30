Title: The Linux Kernel Device Mapper userspace library
Maintainer: Stefan Monnier <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>
Source: LVM2.2.02.64.tgz
Type: ipkg
Description:   The Linux Kernel Device Mapper is the LVM (Linux Logical Volume Management)
  Team\'s implementation of a minimalistic kernel-space driver that handles
  volume management, while keeping knowledge of the underlying device layout
  in user-space.  This makes it useful for not only LVM, but EVMS, software
  raid, and other drivers that create "virtual" block devices.
  .
  This package contains the (user-space) shared library for accessing the
  device-mapper; it allows usage of the device-mapper through a clean,
  consistent interface (as opposed to through kernel ioctls).

Title: The Linux Logical Volume Manager
Maintainer: Stefan Monnier <monnier@iro.umontreal.ca>
Source: LVM2.2.02.64.tgz
Type: ipkg
Description:   This is LVM2, the rewrite of The Linux Logical Volume Manager.  LVM
  supports enterprise level volume management of disk and disk subsystems
  by grouping arbitrary disks into volume groups. The total capacity of
  volume groups can be allocated to logical volumes, which are accessed as
  regular block devices.
