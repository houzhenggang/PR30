Title: An mDNS/DNS-SD implementation (library)
Maintainer: OpenWrt Developers Team <openwrt-devel@openwrt.org>
Source: avahi-0.6.25.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:  An mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf) implementation (library).
 Avahi is a system which facilitates service discovery on a local network --
 this means that you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with, find printers
 to print to or find files being shared. This kind of technology is already
 found in MacOS X (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 This package contains the mDNS/DNS-SD shared libraries, used by other programs.

 This package implements IPv4LL, "Dynamic Configuration of IPv4 Link-Local 
 Addresses" (IETF RFC3927), a protocol for automatic IP address configuration 
 from the link-local 169.254.0.0/16 range without the need for a central 
 server. It is primarily intended to be used in ad-hoc networks which lack a
 DHCP server.
