Description:  LibTorrent is a BitTorrent library written in C++ for *nix, with a focus
 on high performance and good code. The library differentiates itself from
 other implementations by transfering directly from file pages to the
 network stack. On high-bandwidth connections it is able to seed at 3 times
 the speed of the official client.
