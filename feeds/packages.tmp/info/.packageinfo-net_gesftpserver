Type: ipkg
Description: This is an experimental free SFTP server. It is currently still under development
(so don't trust it with critical data). It should be possible to use it as a
drop-in replacement for the widely-used OpenSSH SFTP server. It does not include
an SSH server, but rather runs as a subsystem of one.
